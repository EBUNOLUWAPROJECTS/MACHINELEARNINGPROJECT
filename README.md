Lagos Housing Rent Predictor

Project Overview
This is the project to solve Housing prices in Lagos, Nigeria, and aims to build an accurate location-specific house rent predictor. In Lagos, the most populous city in Africa, acute housing shortages have pushed up rents astronomically. Key factors contributing to this challenge include the Lagos subsidy Law, multiple taxes, and high construction costs. The solution is to have a mixed-income model, with 15% of housing units reserved for low and moderate-income earners.

Problem Statement
This project seeks to solve a basic but needful problem which is the non-existence of viable House rent predictors for various neighborhoods in Lagos. Most rental platforms do not provide the sufficient level of granularity that is required to make accurate and location-specific predictions. This currently limits the ability of renters to understand rental prices in different parts of the city, thereby causing them financial strain and dissatisfaction with their housing choices.

Proposed Solution
The project involves developing a location-specific house rent predictor using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. The predictor will analyze historical rental data, current market conditions, and future trends to generate personalized rental predictions. It will consider various factors influencing rental prices, such as neighborhood amenities, infrastructure, proximity to essential services, and overall living conditions. The predictor will also factor in fluctuations in the real estate market, economic trends, and demographic changes to ensure accuracy and relevance over time.

Data Source
Data for this project is extracted from the Real Estate website PropertyPro.NG. The dataset includes various features that are crucial for developing the house rent predictor:

Title of the Home/Listing: Indicates whether the property is a duplex, apartment, land, or flat.
Location of Home: Provides information on the city and neighborhood/area.
Price of Home: Initially recorded as a string, converted to integers for analysis.
Newly Built: Indicates whether the home is newly built (True/False).
Serviced: Specifies if the home is serviced (True/False).
Furnished: Shows if the home is furnished (True/False).
Number of Bedrooms: Converted from string to integer.
Number of Bathrooms: Converted from string to integer.
Number of Toilets: Converted from string to integer.
